      <h2>Ambo Privacy Policy</h2>
      Last updated: January 21, 2021 <br /><br />
      
      <p>
        Ambo and MyCrypto value your privacy and security, and actively work to collect as little of your personal information as possible. Nonetheless, any company providing publicly available services on the internet will inevitably collect information about those who it interacts with or those who utilize its services (“Users”) through its normal business operations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This document (“Privacy Policy”) explains how MyCrypto, Inc. collects, stores, uses, handles and protects personal information collected through its normal business operations, as it relates specifically to the services offered by Ambo, including those accessible on the website located at https://ambo.io (the “Site”), those accessible on the Ambo iOS application, those provided during contact with Ambo through direct communication, those provided by interacting with Ambo on social media, and using any other services owned or provided by Ambo (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;), you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy. <br> <br>Note: Information collected through the use of MyCrypto products, including that gathered on MyCrypto.com, the MyCrypto Desktop Application, MoneroVision.com, EtherScamDB.info, CryptoScamDB, is subject to a separate privacy policy and the terms of this Policy do not apply.<br> <br>The terms &quot;us,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; or &quot;our&quot; refer to Ambo.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The Blockchain</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the inherent transparency of some blockchains, transactions you broadcast via Ambo may be publicly accessible. This includes (but is not limited to) your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent, and any other data you may choose to include. Information stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and not easily removed or deleted. Your transactions and addresses may reveal information about you, and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Please review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ambo Collection of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo does not sell any information or data to any third party, nor does it release such information except as stated in this policy. Ambo does not have user accounts, and it collects very little identifying information in our systems. Private keys, encryption passwords, and all other information necessary to operate our products are owned, controlled, managed, and possessed by Users (unless they opt to utilize another service or product which would be completely outside of our control), and never come in contact with our servers or systems. This section explains how Ambo collects information through its delivery of the Services.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ambo Key Interface</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo’s mobile app (including key pair generator and unlocking functionality) never records nor transmits any of your private keys or encryption passwords. All information is entered and processed by your device, so Ambo, its employees, and its servers never have the opportunity to collect your private key, encryption password, or other related information.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Information Collected on the Server Side</h3>
      <p>
        Some Ambo products have server-side functions hosted by third-party providers or that employ third-party security and functionality services. Ambo and its third-party providers may collect limited information as is standard and appropriate to secure our Services, detect and debug issues, and provide the best user experience. Information pertaining to a user’s account, balances, or IP addresses may be stored for a limited amount of time in the form of logs. All raw log data is automatically deleted after 90 days. This information is not correlated, stored, or connected to any client-side analytics (below).Information collected on the Server Side will not be shared with nor sold to any third-party.
      </p>
        
      <h3>Information Collected on the Client Side</h3>
      <p>
        Some Ambo products collect usage analytics on the client-side in order to better understand how people are using the product. We protect your information using the latest technology and best practices for technical and administrative security. Some examples of usage data we do collect automatically:
        <ul>
          <li>Date and time accessed</li>
          <li>Name of the page or feature being accessed</li>
          <li>Time spent on each page or feature</li>
          <li>Screen resolution and device being used</li>
          <li>Links to outside domains that are accessed</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        
        Some examples of data we do not collect automatically:
        <ul>
          <li>Private keys or other secret information</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency addresses</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency balances</li>
          <li>Mouse movements, clicks, scrolls</li>
          <li>Order execution information</li>
        </ul>
        
        Information collected client-side is stored separately from information collected by Ambo servers (above), and is not shared with nor sold to any third party.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Collection of Cryptocurrency Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        MyCrypto does not generally record or store cryptocurrency addresses belonging to users. However, limited Ambo functionalities or other circumstances may require collection and storage of such, such as contests, user support interactions, special token requests, or balance requests. Cryptocurrency addresses collected for any purpose are not correlated, connected, or stored in relation to the usage analytics collected on the client side. Further, cryptocurrency addresses will be stored in a manner that is reasonably necessary for Ambo to perform its business operations effectively and are removed upon the completion of those business operations (typically 90 days or less).
      </p>

      <h3>Ambo Email, Telephone, or Other Two-Way Communications</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo prides itself in its frequent contact with Users and the community. These two-way communications may occur via telephone, email, in-person, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Reddit, text message, voicemail, Signal, Wickr, Facebook (and/or Messenger), Twitter, written letter, or any other method. Records of these conversations may be kept in written, recorded, or digital form, as permitted by law, in a manner that is reasonably necessary for Ambo to perform its business operations effectively. 

        <br /><br />
        
        Emails sent to support@ambo.io are automatically destroyed after one year, though they may be deleted sooner for security or other purposes. Other two-way communications will be stored consistent with this Policy. Nothing in this section should be construed as guaranteeing that communications records will be kept for any amount of time, if at all.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ambo Newsletter</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo loves finding as many channels to communicate with its users and community. We use Mailchimp to help create and send effective newsletters. You can sign up for our Newsletter to keep up with our developments by submitting your email address to the sign-up form in the footer of Ambo.io. Email addresses collected through our Newsletter submission form will only be used for the purpose of sharing relevant information about our products and services with subscribers. If you would like to unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time, you can do so by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button that is found within the emails that are sent from Ambo.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Social Media</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo relies on social media as a primary means of communicating with its community and Users. We do not generally delete communications and other information shared on social media, though we reserve the right to do so for any reason without warning. We also do not generally save these communications offline, though we reserve the right to do so for any reason or no reason, and without warning.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        Any information or communication you share with us via social media is also subject to those platforms’ terms of use and/or privacy policies. The following is a list of Ambo’s official social media handles along with links to the respective platforms’ terms of use and/or privacy policies:

          </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Storage of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo follows responsible data storage methods and protocols consistent with blockchain and crypto-asset wallet industry standards. We use a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other information technology to provide our Services and store your personal information. We protect your information using the latest technology and best practices for technical and administrative security. These best practices include firewalls, narrowly-tailored internal breach recognition and notification procedures, data encryption, and controlled employee and third-party access to our information databases.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        We use what little data and information that is collected by our Services to provide a more enjoyable and efficient user experience. Any of this data and information will be destroyed/deleted after a reasonable period of time (if not sooner). We reserve all rights to determine “reasonability” at our sole discretion, as is consistent with the rest of this Policy and/or is required by law.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        Given the relatively small amount of information that we do collect and our best data storage and security practices, it is relatively unlikely that a data breach may occur against Ambo that would affect User personally identifiable information. Nonetheless, the realities of operating a service online dictate that a nonzero-chance exists of such a breach. In the case of such an event, we will use our official Twitter and other social media as a formal means of notifying the community (as we do not have user accounts and associated email addresses). We also use these channels to notify the community of any other prominent security issues in the Ethereum and crypto ecosystems at large (regardless if they directly relate to Ambo). Thus, we highly recommend you follow those resources and check them frequently for up-to-date information.
      </p>
        
      <h3>Use of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Information collected by Ambo may be used to develop new products, improve Services’ performance, provide industry-leading user support, or for its own marketing or other internal purposes. The content of any two-way communications should be considered the sole property of Ambo, and we reserve the right to use those communications for any purpose. Nonetheless, any identifiable information associated with those communications will not be disclosed to a third-party without consent of both parties or unless otherwise explained in this Privacy Policy.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        Ambo never sells any of its collected information to third parties. Ambo may, from time to time, share information with third-party vendors in order to efficiently and effectively provide its Services. Ambo makes no guarantee and takes no responsibility as to those entities’ privacy and data utilization practices. We reserve all rights to determine which data is necessary to share with third-party vendors to effectively and efficiently provide our Services at our sole discretion. Ambo intends to publicly disclose third parties with whom it has formed relations without compromising security, violating the terms of any legally binding agreement required to procure such services, or in any other way that may compromise our Services’ safety, usability, or efficiency.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo’s Services utilize anonymous information through small data files known as “cookies,” which are stored in a User’s local browser. This allows for a browser to act in favorable ways based on previous activity. For example, they may be used to ensure our Services are presented in your preferred language, ensure your browser points to your preferred node, to ensure you have completed certain onboarding steps, or for other enhanced performance features not contemplated by this Policy.
        
        <br /><br />
        
        We specifically utilize localStorage for the storage of these pieces of data and as such this information is only stored in a User’s browser, not on our servers, and may be deleted by a user at any time by clearing his or her browser’s cache. Unlike traditional cookies, these pieces of data are not sent to the server with each request.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        The following is a list of some of those third parties who may obtain User information (and under what conditions) as well as links to their relevant information practices documents. Ambo shall make reasonable efforts to keep this list as up-to-date as possible:

            </ul>
          </ul>

          The above list only includes third-party providers whose information practices we could obtain after reasonable research and solicitation. Please be aware that the use of any non-listed third-party services is at the User’s risk own discretion, and (like any other third-party services) Ambo will not be liable to Users for any use or harm caused by the use of those products as permitted by law.

          <br /><br />

          Notwithstanding the above, some third-party relationships (including, but not limited to, webhosting or DDoS prevention services) may require confidential relationships and data disclosure practices due to emergent security or other practical concerns, and therefore are not listed in this Privacy Policy. Ambo reserves the right to determine whether confidentiality is necessary, and, if so, how to operate in such circumstances at its own discretion. Nonetheless, no such relationship will involve knowingly disclosing personally identifiable information for marketing purposes or in any other way inconsistent with this Policy.
        </p>

        <h5>Law Enforcement Purposes</h5>
        <p>
          If required by a subpoena or court order, Ambo will share personal information with law enforcement agencies in order to comply with legal requirements. Ambo will make reasonable efforts to notify any subjects of such informational disclosure as is permitted by law. Ambo may disclose your personal information to the appropriate legal authorities should we deem it necessary to prevent and/or report physical harm, violations of our Terms of Service, and/or illegal activities. This includes complying with regulations to prevent money laundering and terrorist activities.
        </p>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Amendments</h3>
      <p>
        Ambo may alter this Privacy Policy at its discretion at any time for any or no reason. Any changes will include a corresponding “Last updated” date shown at the top of this page and such changes will go in effect immediately. Prominent notice of any changes may be posted on our site or social media, though such notice is not guaranteed and you should check for updates regularly. The latest version of the Privacy Policy will be considered as superseding any previous version unless otherwise noted.
      </p>
